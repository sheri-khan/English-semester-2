            <h2>Memo writing</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Memo Writing</b> <br>
                A memorandum, also known as a memo, is informing a group or organization in an email or letter of a
                specific problem and/or solution. A memo should have an action plan with specific steps on how to carry
                out the plan. Memorandums should be short, concise, and easy to read. <br>

                Features of a Memo <br>
                • Is it addressed to the right audience?
                • Does the subject line accurately convey its contents?
                • Does it anticipate and address potential objections?
                • Is it formatted clearly and consistently? <br>
                Instructions: <br>
                • The opening paragraph should restate the memo's purpose indicated in the subject line.
                • Notice also how each of our memo examples' subsequent paragraphs build on this opening statement and
                explain the memo's purpose in detail.
                • Unnecessary information should be removed, and word choice should remain straightforward and
                professional.
                Example:
                Dear Students, This is to let you know there is a mistake in the reading list for this week. The
                literature list you all received is from last year and is outdated. We have since made changes, and
                these changes are outlined below. <br>
            
                <b>MEMORANDUM </b><br>
                To: All First-Year Psychology Students<br>
                From: Professor Jenkins<br>
                Date: October 23, 2021<br>
                Subject: Update to this week's assignment<br>
                Dear Students,<br>
                This is to let you know there is a mistake in the reading list for this week.
                The literature list you all received is from last year and is outdated. We have since made changes, and
                these changes are outlined below.<br>
                Instead of reading Chapters 1–3 of The Science of Psychology, and Chapters 6–8 of Neurobiology, read
                Chapters 2–3 of The Science of Psychology and Chapters 5–8 of Neurobiology.
                Please be sure to follow these new instructions.<br>
                Best regards,<br>
                Professor Jenkins<br>
